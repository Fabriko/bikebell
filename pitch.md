# The Pitch

### What we're capturing

Journeys, experiences and stories that track where, how and why bikers move.

**To provide live data for** businesses and council staff who benefit from knowing how people move and spend in the city.

## The Problem

Cycling is our least-understood and potentially most transformational mode of movement in cities.

Planning decisions are currently based on research undertaken at a specific time of year, or in review of a new piece of infrastructure.

There's currently no in-depth understanding of the human experience of cycling or access to an ever evolving pool of user stories.

## The Challenge

To create a participatory platform that enables citizens to share their biking stories to positively promote cycling and help shape our cycling infrastructure.

## The Concept

### A Smart Bike Bell

To create a bike friendly device in the form of a bell ..

Riders sound one ring for a negative experience and two for a positive experience. Experiences, captured on the.journey via a mobile phone, are sent to the cloud in real time and displayed on an interactive map. Vibrant stories shared by participants would help encourage friends to get out on their bikes, and over time, rider contributions to the experience map would provide useful insights for cycleway planners.

### An Open Heat Map

At the core of the challenge is to create a device and interface that encourages citizen participation. To achieve this, the process must be citizen led. Participants can contribute anonomously to an open heat map, adding to a community of experiences and stories that have the.power to influence the way we move around our cities.

### Spreading Stories

Biking is a sensory experience. On a bike, you.are closer to nature, you physically feel the elements. Every bump on the road. The sound of nature and traffic. Wind and gravity working for and against you. It's a heightened experience that feeds personal stories, both positive and negative. By focusing on capturing and.sharing stories about riding, the App has the potential to increase awareness of the biker's journey. In turn, these stories have the potential to influence other people to ride and shape the way a city is built.
