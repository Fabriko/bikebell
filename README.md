# Sensibel

Improving cycle networks by rich, passionately gathered user-generated data:

* allows riders to share and easily feed back on experiences
* provides planners and maintainers with authentic, current, precise, and meaningful information for their decisions

3 components in early development,

* Hardware,
* Firmware,
* [Cross-platform smartphone app](MobileApp/README.md),

and another _planned_,

* _web-based analysis suite_.

_Data is open, but anonymised by default._

**Data gets more valuable to planners as it builds.**

The _product_ is better cycling options, with the end result of further conversions

We completed a funded pilot in late 2015. We develop this for love where we can and [pitch for further funding](./pitch.md) so we can continue. We'd love to get payed to advance something that benefits nearly everyone.
