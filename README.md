Improving cycle networks by rich, passionately gathered user-generated data:

* allows riders to share and easily feed back on experiences
* provides planners and maintainers with authentic, current, precise, and meaningful information for their decisions

4 components in early development:

* [Hardware casing](Hardware/case),
* _Firmware_,
* [Cross-platform smartphone app](MobileApp),
* [Web-based analysis suite](DataAnalysis).

_Data is open, but anonymised by default._

**Data gets more valuable to planners as it builds.**

The _product_ is better cycling options, with the end result of further conversions.

We completed a funded pilot in late 2015. In 2016, we further developed it in partnership for a phased Auckland study relating to transport modal shifting.

We develop this for love where we can and [pitch for further funding](./pitch.md) so we can continue. We'd love to get payed to advance something that benefits nearly everyone.

A little more information is available on the [Sensibel website](http://sensibel.org).
